This is a collection of screenshots of cosy cabins, rooms and houses I've stumbled upon whilst watching television and films.

{{< epigraph pre="For the Fallen by Robert Laurence Binyon" >}}
They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old;  
Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.  
At the going down of the sun and in the morning.  
We will remember them.

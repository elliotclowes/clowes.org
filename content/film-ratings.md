90% = Masterpiece: Life changing stuff.  
80% = Amazing: One of the films of the year.  
70% = Good: Certainly worth a trip to the cinema.  
60% = Decent: Flawed, but still watch it.  
50% = Average: Only if you've got spare time and like the genre/actor/etc.  
40% = Disappointing: Not worth your money and watch it in the background.  
30% = Bad: Don't watch it.  
20% = Terrible: Really don't watch it.  
10% = Awful: Please, do not watch this garbage.  

## Notes

If a film is **underlined** in means it's a particular favourite of mine or underrated/under-watched.

These are personal ratings, not objective ones. There are plenty of films here with an equal rating to an obviously technically superior film. But because they connected with me they have been given a high score.

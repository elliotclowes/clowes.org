Summary &amp;amp; Review A look at Sigmund Freud, William Halsted and the birth of cocaine. It explores how the two men were enraptured by the promise of the new miracle drug but how ultimately its clinical application was limited, while the personal usage by the two men was unlimited. Freud seemingly shook off his cocaine addiction, Halsted never quite did.</description>

      <description>Clowes.org is the homepage of me, Elliot Clowes (hi there!). Essentially it&amp;rsquo;s just a place for me to put my writing, photos and general thoughts online. I do also write two blogs. One is about technology. And the other is a microblog, and about anything and everything. I enjoy writing them. But the problem with blogs is that every post is treated equally and their chronological layout means things you consider important gets lost on page 17, alongside the quickly hammered hate-post you wrote on a movie you hate.</description>

      <description>Album Reviews Cowboy Reach for the Sky (1971) Starts a little quirky, but settles as the album goes on. This is a nice and soft country rock-ish album. 7/10
Stand out songs: Pretty Friend, Everything Here, It&amp;rsquo;s Time and Josephine Beyond Compare.</description>

 They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old;
Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.
At the going down of the sun and in the morning.
We will remember them.

      <description>I’m a big fan of The Setup. It’s “a collection of nerdy interviews asking people from all walks of life what they use to get the job done.” So in the spirit of it, I’ve decided to do my own. You can can see previous editions: 2013, 2014 and 2016. My initial plan was to do a new one each year, but s you can see I have failed in my duty.</description>

      <description>Highlighted Sections  Dickens now did something extraordinary. Nine months before he finished Pickwick Papers, this man of prodigious energy, only twenty-five years old, began to write Oliver Twist, one of the world’s most famous novels, whose ‘Please, sir, I want some more’ is familiar even to the millions who have never read it. And then, five months after he completed Pickwick, he started his third novel, Nicholas Nickleby, before Oliver Twist, his second, had reached its halfway point.</description>

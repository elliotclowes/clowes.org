<p>Quite how a director who was inexperienced at making big blockbusters, in a country without a big film industry, managed to make <em>the</em> biggest and <em>the</em> best blockbuster of all time is a miracle. It should not have worked. Something like Lord of the Rings is unlikely to be repeated again for a long, long time.<label for="sidenote-8723697e33f65823610bf3f676b8d742-0" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-8723697e33f65823610bf3f676b8d742-0" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">For good reason. I would argue it was reckless for that much money to be given to a relatively unknown director for such a high budget <em>fantasy</em> film.<br><br></span>
</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s 20 years on and all three films still hold up. Even the CGI.<label for="sidenote-8723697e33f65823610bf3f676b8d742-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label>
<input type="checkbox" id="sidenote-8723697e33f65823610bf3f676b8d742-1" class="margin-toggle"/>
<span class="sidenote">CGI from other films of the period haven&rsquo;t achieved really this.<br><br></span>
. And the fact you can have an entirely CGI character like Golumn still emote so much feeling in you all these years on was remarkable at the time and doubly so now.</p>
<p>The worldbuilding achieved by director Peter Jackson and crew is one my favourite things about these films. Watching them in the cinema as a kid I was totally transported. The Shire and Bag End is still my dream place to live. It&rsquo;s my utopia. My heaven.</p>
<p>Its <em>long</em> score by Howard Shore is beautiful and iconic and is his best work.</p>

<h3 id="music">Music</h3>
<p>My favourite genre is rock and folk from the 1960&rsquo;s and 1970&rsquo;s. But I also enjoy and have a passing interest in prog rock, classical, jazz, funk, country, blues and ambient.</p>
<p>Below are some of my favourite bands/musicians, kind of ranked.</p>
<h4 id="van-morrison">Van Morrison</h4>

<span class="marginnote"><img src="/image/van-morrison.jpg" alt=""></span>
He&rsquo;s not in vogue these days, and is maybe seen as a middling creator of decent romantic songs that are liked by the dull rank and file of the middle class. But I think some of his songs have an almost religious quality that transcend music and get to an entirely different plane. He has a certain sound, with a subtle, gentle layering that often builds, repeats and folds whilst Morrison&rsquo;s powerful, slightly erratic voice moves, swerves and jumps from line to line – and often syllable to syllable – in a way that I simply adore.</p>
<p>His finest albums are probably <a href="https://songwhip.com/van-morrison/astral-weeks1968">Astral Weeks</a>, <a href="https://songwhip.com/van-morrison/moondance1970">Moondance</a>, <a href="https://songwhip.com/van-morrison/saintdominicspreview">Saint Dominic&rsquo;s Preview</a>, <a href="https://songwhip.com/van-morrison/veedon-fleece">Veedon Fleece</a> and <a href="https://songwhip.com/van-morrison/into-the-music">Into The Music</a>. But the good thing about Morrison is that he has few stinkers and his albums outside his artistic peak post-1970&rsquo;s are still certainly worth exploring, as they nearly all contain a great song or two.</p>
<p>If you want to get into Morrison I have <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6E9TjhSqSN6EZglIGw8s2I?si=8143936c315b411d">this playlist on Spotify</a>. It contains every song of his that I think isn&rsquo;t <em>actively</em> average, poor or just very dull. It&rsquo;s a good way of listening to his entire discography, but without the songs that I feel simply aren&rsquo;t worth your time.</p>

    <section><p><em>Clowes.org</em> is the homepage of me, Elliot Clowes (hi there!). Essentially it&rsquo;s just a place for me to put my writing, photos and general thoughts online. I do also write two blogs. One is about technology. And the other is a microblog, and about anything and everything. I enjoy writing them. But the problem with blogs is that every post is treated equally and their chronological layout means things you consider important gets lost on page 17, alongside the quickly hammered hate-post you wrote on a movie you hate. Things are just fairly ephemeral there.</p>
<p>So <em>Clowes.org</em> is a more &lsquo;solid&rsquo; place, where my thoughts on - I don&rsquo;t know - alcohol, have a dedicated page where I&rsquo;ve tried to distill my thoughts, rather than have them spread over a dozen blog posts.</p>
<h2 id="powered-by">Powered by&hellip;</h2>
<p>This website is powered by <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, a static site creator. And it uses <a href="https://github.com/slashformotion/hugo-tufte">hugo-tufte</a> as its base theme. I really like <em>Clowes.org</em> being a bunch of static files as it makes hosting extremely easy. No databases or dealing with PHP and all the annoyance that entails. I don&rsquo;t even need to run this site on a proper server with a CPU. All I pay for is a service that hosts static files. It&rsquo;s dead simple and dead cheap.</p>
<p>It also makes backups a breeze. Again, it&rsquo;s just a bunch of static files! Currently the size of this entire website is &lt;1MB. And things are unlikely to ever break. I don&rsquo;t have to worry about a database getting corrupted or my WordPress installation being hacked.</p>
